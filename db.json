First Post","date":"2016-11-04T03:07:52.000Z","comments":1,"subtitle":"Welcome to the inside of my mind","cover_index":"../images/firstPost.jpg","_content":"\nThis is my first post! I finally spooled up a blog, and now I have the time to tell you about myself. I could give you a lengthy diatribe on who I am, but all that will come in time. For the first post, I'm going to tell you about how I made this blog.\n\n### Selection\n\nI went through several different options before I picked out Hexo. There were several things to consider, and I used the following criteria in my selection process. They are as follows:\n\n#### My criteria:\n\n1. Runs on Node.js.\n2. Minimal database creation. I feel like being lazy.\n3. Extensible and easily replaceable themes. I get bored, and I wanted maintainability and support for future laziness.\n4. Deployment through my own server. I have a Digital Ocean Droplet (more on that in a later blog), and I wanted to be able to run this bad boy on it. What's the point of calling myself \"Full Stack\" if I can't demonstrate it?\n\n### Ghost\n\nI started with the requisite Google search: \"Blog developer nodejs.\" The only thing that came up was Ghost, so naturally, I tried it. I didn't really like it, mostly because it's in alpha and things are broken. It's going to be a cool product, and I'll switch at some point, but while it's in alpha, that will make deployment and maintenance problematic.\n\nGhost runs Handlebars and Ember.js, which are awesome. If you know Vanilla JS, you know Ember, and Handlebars is built off of Mustache templates. Again, if you've used one templating language, you've used most of them. I haven't seen large differences in any of them (templating languages), but I also haven't used many of them in large scale production/to the nth degree.\n\nSince I build in React at work, I didn't feel like learning Ember this week. So, no Ghost for now.\n\n## Bringing us to... Hexo.\n\nHexo is a blog platfom built by [Tommy Chen](http://www.hexo.io), and it's pretty sweet. Hexo hits all of my requirements, save for being able to access the index.js (Node.js) file directly. If I need to add something, it's a little more complex than calling `import blank from 'blankity-blank`, but it runs quite well otherwise. I can import themes, and I can write and edit all of my blog posts in Markdown!\n\n### Fun, Unexpected Features\n\n#### Yaml\nHexo uses *[Yaml](http://www.yaml.org/start.html)* in most of its configuration files in lieu of the usual JSON. Haven't used it a lot thus far, and I'm really excited to dig more into it as I extend this blog out further. There's a lot of stuff going on under the hood in Hexo, and I haven't investigated a lot of it.\n\n#### A Robust NPM Community\nWith over 100 well-maintained packages, there are a lot of things I can add to Hexo to extend and customize its functionality. I don't plan on deploying to Github Pages or Heroku, but it's nice to have the option at my fingertips.\n\n#### A community of designers\nThere's a lot of extensible inspiration online, and there are a lot of awesome people sharing themes.

I finally spooled up a blog, and now I have the time to tell you about myself. I could give you a lengthy diatribe on who I am, but all that will come in time. For the first post, I'm going to tell you about how I made this blog.\n\n### Selection\n\nI went through several different options before I picked out Hexo. There were several things to consider, and I used the following criteria in my selection process. They are as follows:\n\n#### My criteria:\n\n1. Runs on Node.js.\n2. Minimal database creation. I feel like being lazy.\n3. Extensible and easily replaceable themes. I get bored, and I wanted maintainability and support for future laziness.\n4. Deployment through my own server. I have a Digital Ocean Droplet (more on that in a later blog), and I wanted to be able to run this bad boy on it. What's the point of calling myself \"Full Stack\" if I can't demonstrate it?\n\n### Ghost\n\nI started with the requisite Google search: \"Blog developer nodejs.\" The only thing that came up was Ghost, so naturally, I tried it. I didn't really like it, mostly because it's in alpha and things are broken. It's going to be a cool product, and I'll switch at some point, but while it's in alpha, that will make deployment and maintenance problematic.\n\nGhost runs Handlebars and Ember.js, which are awesome. If you know Vanilla JS, you know Ember, and Handlebars is built off of Mustache templates. Again, if you've used one templating language, you've used most of them. I haven't seen large differences in any of them (templating languages), but I also haven't used many of them in large scale production/to the nth degree.\n\nSince I build in React at work, I didn't feel like learning Ember this week. So, no Ghost for now.\n\n## Bringing us to... Hexo.\n\nHexo is a blog platfom built by [Tommy Chen](http://www.hexo.io), and it's pretty sweet. Hexo hits all of my requirements, save for being able to access the index.js (Node.js) file directly. If I need to add something, it's a little more complex than calling `import blank from 'blankity-blank`, but it runs quite well otherwise. I can import themes, and I can write and edit all of my blog posts in Markdown!\n\n### Fun, Unexpected Features\n\n#### Yaml\nHexo uses *[Yaml](http://www.yaml.org/start.html)* in most of its configuration files in lieu of the usual JSON. Haven't used it a lot thus far, and I'm really excited to dig more into it as I extend this blog out further. There's a lot of stuff going on under the hood in Hexo, and I haven't investigated a lot of it.\n\n#### A Robust NPM Community\nWith over 100 well-maintained packages, there are a lot of things I can add to Hexo to extend and customize its functionality. I don't plan on deploying to Github Pages or Heroku, but it's nice to have the option at my fingertips.\n\n#### A community of designers\nThere's a lot of extensible inspiration online, and there are a lot of awesome people sharing themes. My current theme is [Phantom](https://github.com/klugjo/hexo-theme-phantom), and I love its minimalism and conscious UI decisions.\n\n#### CLI\nHexo uses a CLI to spin up blog posts.

Aframe-React presents us with two real components:</p>\n<h4 id=\"lt-Scene-gt\"><a href=\"#lt-Scene-gt\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"&lt;Scene/&gt;\"></a><code>&lt;Scene/&gt;</code></h4><p>Scene functions as a wrapper around <code>&lt;a-scene&gt;</code>. Pretty much just set up. Don’t include it, and you break things.</p>\n<h4 id=\"lt-Entity-gt\"><a href=\"#lt-Entity-gt\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"&lt;Entity /&gt;\"></a><code>&lt;Entity /&gt;</code></h4><p><code>&lt;Entity/&gt;</code>, on the other hand, is where most of the magic happens. Pass a few variables as <code>props</code> in the system, and voilà! Here’s an example of how to make a ‘primitive’ (aka, a box):</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;Entity</div><div class=\"line\">\tanimation__rot=&#123;&#123;property: &apos;rotation&apos;, dur: 2000, loop: true, to: &apos;360 360 360&apos;&#125;&#125;</div><div class=\"line\">\tanimation__sca=&#123;&#123;property: &apos;scale&apos;, dir: &apos;alternate&apos;, dur: 100, loop: true, to: &apos;1.1 1.1 1.1&apos;&#125;&#125;</div><div class=\"line\">\tgeometry=&apos;primitive: box&apos;</div><div class=\"line\">\tmaterial=&#123;&#123;color: &apos;red&apos;, opacity: 1&#125;&#125;</div><div class=\"line\">\tposition=&apos;0 -0.5 -3&apos;</div><div class=\"line\">&lt;/Entity&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The above example comes verbatim from Kevin Ngo’s <em><a href=\"https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react-boilerplate\">Boilerplate</a></em>. Let’s look closer at what it does.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Animation\"><a href=\"#Animation\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Animation\"></a>Animation</h4><p>Each of the animation props give us…animation. The property designates the type of animation; loop, duration, and to provide additional details for the animation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Geometry\"><a href=\"#Geometry\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Geometry\"></a>Geometry</h4><p>Geometry gives us the ‘primitive’ object, a box. It gives us the actual object.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Material\"><a href=\"#Material\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Material\"></a>Material</h4><p>Material designates what goes on the object. It can be a color, or it can be a texture…or a jpeg. Oh man, I had some fun with putting various jpegs on spinning cubes. Long story short, I’m childish.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Position\"><a href=\"#Position\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Position\"></a>Position</h4><p>This places the object within your universe. Together, all of these things give you…</p>\n<h3 id=\"A-Cube\"><a href=\"#A-Cube\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A Cube!\"></a>A Cube!</h3><p><img src=\"../images/vr.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>So that’s that! Kidding, there’s so much more you can do with this tech, and I’ve only scratched the surface. I’m currently working on building an HTML Canvas/Aframe implementation, then porting it over to this React environment. While I’m doing that, I will be eating a fair amount of pie and all the Christmas cookies I can find. Happy Holidays, everyone!</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cix0uetpa00005gx7sfuna1w7","tag_id":"cix0uetph00025gx7z1bwc00q","_id":"cix0uetpm00035gx7oh4nws86"}],"Tag":[{"name":"life","_id":"cix0uetph00025gx7z1bwc00q"}]}}
